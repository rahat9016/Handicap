              Humanity & Inclusion (HI) is an independent and impartial aid
              organization working in situations of poverty and exclusion,
              conflict and disaster. We work alongside people with disabilities
              and vulnerable populations, taking action and bearing witness in
              order to respond to their essential needs, improve their living
              conditions and promote respect for their dignity and fundamental
              rights.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#7A7A8E] text-sm font-inter font-normal mt-3">
              Since 2017, HI has been working in Cox&apos;s Bazar, Bangladesh, to support Rohingya refugees and host communities, with a particular focus on ensuring that persons with disabilities have access to humanitarian services and are included in the response.
